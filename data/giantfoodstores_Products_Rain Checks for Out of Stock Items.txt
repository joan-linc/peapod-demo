Rain checks can be issued in the event an advertised item is out of stock. This includes weekly sale items, as well as multi-week sale items.
Expire after 30 days (exception for long-term out of stocks)
Rain checks are limited to six items, unless otherwise stated. Requests for more than six must be approved by the Store Manager or designate.
Exception for items advertised as a higher quantity – example 10/$10
Note: The Store Manager has the right to limit the quantity issued for any rain check.
Rain checks expire 30 days after being issued.
If a rain check expires prior to the store restocking the item, then the store must extend the rain check to when the item is restocked.
A rain check is a one-time purchase certificate.
Rain checks can be redeemed at any store location.
