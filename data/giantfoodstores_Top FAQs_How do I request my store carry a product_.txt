Although it is not possible for us to carry every product, we make every effort to carry those products that are most in demand. Over time shoppers’ needs change and new products are constantly introduced to meet those needs. Products that don’t sell well may be discontinued so we have the space to add new products. It is a constant juggling act. We rely on market research, information provided by our suppliers, and of course, customer feedback. We regularly review our assortment and compare that with customer requests.

Product suggestion forms are available in our stores or you can send us a request online by using our form . All forms are sent to our buyers who review them along with other market information to determine what products to carry to meet the needs of our diverse customers. However, because of the number of requests we receive, we regret that we cannot respond personally to each request. Be assured that your request will get to the person who buys the type of product you are requesting.

For product availability at a particular store, it is best to call the store directly and speak to the department manager.

Discontinued Products:

If you are inquiring about why a product is no longer stocked in your store, generally products that do not sell well are discontinued to make room for new products coming out on the market. And sometimes, manufacturers discontinue items. We do not provide a service where we can special order products that we do not carry. Many products can be ordered online directly from the manufacturer or other services that specialize in online ordering. Your feedback will be shared with the appropriate buyer.
