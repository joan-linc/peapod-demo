Card Holders can continue to redeem their points at the pump for discounts on gas.  Every 100 points = $0.10 off per gallon. When you have an online account, you unlock additional ways to redeem your points- Grocery dollars and Special offers.
There are several reasons that your points may no longer be active. First, is that the points expired. Points expire on the last day of the following month from which they were received. Second, another member of your household already redeemed the points. If you have further questions, please call GIANT Customer Service at 1-888-814-4268; Monday - Friday 8 a.m. - 7 p.m. ET or Saturday 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. ET.

Customers can choose to split their points between gas discounts and special offers.  The customer must redeem the special offers that he/she would like to use through the App or online prior to scanning the card at the pump.  If the customer scans his/her card at the pump first it will redeem the max discount from available points automatically.
