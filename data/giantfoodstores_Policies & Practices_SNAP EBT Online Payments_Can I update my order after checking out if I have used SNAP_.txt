Yes, after placing your order, you may continue to edit it up until your order cutoff time (typically a few hours before pickup/delivery), but you can only apply SNAP funds once per order.

If your final SNAP subtotal is less than the amount you designated, we will issue a refund to your SNAP account. For any balance remaining on your order — including items not covered by your SNAP payment as well as delivery/pickup fees and driver tip — we’ll charge the payment method you selected at checkout.
