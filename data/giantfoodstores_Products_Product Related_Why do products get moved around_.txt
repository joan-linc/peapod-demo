From time to time, we do make changes in our stores to accommodate new products and dedicate more room to growing categories of products. Some of the changes also are in response to requests or suggestions that we have received from customers or our consumer advisory boards. These types of changes often cause a domino effect resulting in many items being relocated. Whenever we make changes, we will post signs letting customers know the new location for the product. We also update the overhead directories and paper directories, which are available at the customer service desk.
