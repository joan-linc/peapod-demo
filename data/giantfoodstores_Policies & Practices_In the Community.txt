 

How do I go about requesting a contribution from GIANT for my non-profit organization? 

GIANT frequently provides assistance for non-profit, charitable organizations. To be considered for a donation, we ask that you send a letter (no phone calls please), on your not-for-profit organization’s letterhead, to:

GIANT Food Stores
Attn: Community Relations
P.O. Box 249
Carlisle, PA 17013




Please include all supporting documentation, including a copy of your organization’s W9 form, if possible. All correspondence should contain your purpose for writing, the date of your event (if applicable), name, address, phone number of a contact person and what type of donation you are looking for.

We request 6 weeks advance notice of an event.

If you are writing to seek major sponsorship for a program or event, or to develop a partnership with Giant, please be advised that our store promotional programs are planned a minimum of three months in advance.
