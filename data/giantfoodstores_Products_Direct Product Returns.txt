Your complete satisfaction is our number one goal. If for any reason you are dissatisfied with a product in your order, please call our Customer Care Department at 1-888-814-4268 and a representative will be happy to assist you. You have up to 7 days after delivery, or until the expiration date printed on the product — whichever is earlier — to contact us for resolution. GIANT may require the return of products prior to issuing a credit. Some exceptions may apply.

If you are missing a product which is not noted as out of stock, you have 48 hours from the time of delivery to notify GIANT Customer Care for a full refund. This is not applicable to alcoholic products - the driver must be notified at the time of delivery.
