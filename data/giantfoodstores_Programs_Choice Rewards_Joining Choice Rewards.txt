Existing GIANT Card members are now Choice Rewards members.  All you need to do is access your online account to earn and redeem points in new ways.
Customers can sign up for an account online by creating a GIANT Account. When creating an account online for the first time, you will be able to print a temporary card that you can use immediately. Continue to use your temporary card until you receive your new card in the mail.

You may also sign up for a card at the Customer Service Desk. You will receive a card on the spot and may begin using it right away. However, we recommend that you sign up online in order to take advantage of the online offers.
