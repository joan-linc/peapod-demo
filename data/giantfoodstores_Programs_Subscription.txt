What Happened To PodPass? Can I Still Use My PodPass Subscription?

PodPass is now GIANT Choice Pass. Members still get the same savings, but we’ve added additional value by letting you use your membership any day of the week. And we’ve simplified the program by offering 2 membership options: annual and monthly.

If you are a PodPass subscriber, you can keep using your current subscription until it expires. To continue after your subscription ends, you’ll need to re-enroll in GIANT Choice Pass and choose either the annual or monthly membership.
