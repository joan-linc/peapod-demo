You can change your information and request a new card anytime online. Your information will be updated and your previous records will be transferred to your new card. You can also visit any GIANT store to make a change to your information or to request a new card by visiting the Customer Service Desk.


When you apply for an account, you will receive one card and two key tags, so three members of your household can use them. Please remember: when one or more cardholders have the same last name and live at the same address, they are automatically "linked" into a household account. This means that any member of that household with a card can earn points and redeem available offers. To find out if there are other cards in your household that are linked to you, or to unlink other cards from your card, please call our Customer Care at 1-888-814-4268; Monday - Friday 8 a.m. - 7 p.m. ET or Saturday 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. ET
