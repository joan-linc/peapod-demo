You can sign up for a GIANT Card online by creating a GIANT Account. When you apply for a GIANT Card online for the first time and create your GIANT Account, you will be able to print a temporary GIANT Card Card that you can use immediately. Continue to use your temporary card until you receive your new GIANT Card in the mail.

You may also sign up for a GIANT Card at the Customer Service Desk. You will receive a card on the spot and may begin using it right away. However, we recommend that you sign up online in order to take advantage of the online offers.
