We comply with state and federal laws regarding the sale and delivery of alcoholic products. The legal age to purchase alcohol is 21; no one under this age may place or receive an order that includes liquor, wine or beer.

We check the identification of all customers receiving alcoholic products. Please have your proper identification materials ready to present to our driver. Deliveries of alcoholic products will not be made to anyone who cannot provide a United States government issued identification verifying that they are of legal age, or to anyone who is visibly intoxicated.

 

If a qualified adult is not available to accept delivery of the regulated products, or if our delivery driver suspects that the alcoholic products are intended for underage drinkers, the delivery driver will remove these items from the order.

 

ACCEPTABLE FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION

Valid State Drivers license (Out of State may require additional Identification)
Valid State photo Identification
United States Active Duty Military ID
Valid United States Passport

GOVERNMENT WARNING

According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects.

 

It is a violation punishable under law for any person under the age of twenty-one to present any written evidence of age which is false, fraudulent or not actually his own for the purpose of attempting to purchase any alcoholic beverages.
