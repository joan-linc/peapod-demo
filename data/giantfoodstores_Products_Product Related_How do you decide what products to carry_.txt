Although it is not possible for us to carry every product, we make every effort to carry those products that are most in demand. Over time shoppers’ needs change and new products are constantly introduced to meet those needs. Products that don’t sell well may be discontinued so we have the space to add new products. It is a constant juggling act. We rely on market research; information provided by our suppliers, and of course, customer feedback. We regularly review our assortment and compare that with customer requests.
