For any balance remaining on your order after you apply SNAP funds, including delivery/pickup fees and driver tip, weâ€™ll charge your preferred credit/debit card or checking account. You can select your preferred payment method from the order summary screen.

Please note that your estimated total at checkout is subject to change due to actual weights and availability. We promise to only charge the true, final cost of your order and refund any differences to your SNAP account or payment method. See your final order invoice for details.
