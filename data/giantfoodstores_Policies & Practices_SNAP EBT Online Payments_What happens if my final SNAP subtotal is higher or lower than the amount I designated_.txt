Once your order is finalized, we will apply the SNAP funds to as many eligible items in your cart as possible. We will never charge your EBT card more than the amount you entered.

If your final SNAP subtotal is less than the amount you designated, we will issue a refund to your SNAP account. For any balance remaining on your order — including items not covered by your SNAP payment as well as delivery/pickup fees and driver tip — we’ll charge your preferred credit/debit card or checking account. You can select your preferred payment method from the order summary screen at checkout.
