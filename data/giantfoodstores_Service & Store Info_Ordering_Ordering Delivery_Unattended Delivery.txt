Delivery Instructions

During checkout, include instructions for your GIANT Delivery Driver as to where to leave your delivery. Choose an area outside your home that is accessible yet secure and protected, keeping weather conditions in mind. We cannot be responsible for any unforeseen damage or theft that occurs to your order. If, for any reason, your GIANT Delivery Driver feels the designated area is unsafe, we reserve the right to not leave your order.

Coupons & Tips

Coupons and tips should be left in a conspicuous spot in the designated delivery area for your GIANT Delivery Driver to collect. Coupons will be credited to your account. If you have a PodBag™, coupons and tips can be left in the small pocket located on the front right corner of your bag.

Alcoholic Beverages

Alcoholic beverages cannot be delivered with our unattended service.

Warnings

Your order may be packed with dry ice to ensure product quality. Do not touch dry ice with your bare hands. Simply allow the unused portion of dry ice to sublimate in a well-ventilated area.
