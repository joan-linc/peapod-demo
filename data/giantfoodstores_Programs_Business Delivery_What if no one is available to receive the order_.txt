You may select our Unattended Delivery Service (where available). The delivery driver will deliver your order in temperature-controlled bins to a secure area outside your business. For unattended deliveries, you may not order alcohol or tobacco products.

To ensure the freshness of your products, your order may be packed with dry ice.

Do not touch dry ice with your bare hands. Simply allow the dry ice to evaporate.
