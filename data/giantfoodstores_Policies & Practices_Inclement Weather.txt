While we make every effort to deliver your order within your selected window, unforeseen events such as inclement weather, traffic and other extraordinary incidents may cause your order to be delivered after the window, or require us to reschedule your order

In this event, our Customer Care department may deliver an automated call to the contact phone number we have on record for you with important details on the status of your order. Please follow the instructions in the call so that we may best handle your order.

To make sure your phone number is current, go to My Account.
