First, add your SNAP EBT Account, including your EBT card number, to your account profile under Payment Information.

After shopping for grocery items, go to your cart and select “Checkout.” Then look for the SNAP checkbox on the order summary screen. Make sure you have entered any promo codes before selecting “Apply SNAP benefits.”

Then you can review the SNAP-eligible items and subtotal from your cart and enter an amount to charge to your SNAP account. Enter your PIN to complete the SNAP transaction and immediately deduct the funds from your SNAP account.

To finish checking out, select “Place Order.” You may continue to edit your order up until your order cutoff time (typically a few hours before pickup/delivery), but you can only apply SNAP funds once per order.

Once your order is finalized, we will apply the SNAP funds to as many eligible items in your cart as possible. We will never charge your EBT card for more than the amount you entered.

If your final SNAP subtotal is less than the amount you designated, we will issue a refund to your SNAP account. For any balance remaining on your order, including delivery/pickup fees and driver tip, we’ll charge the payment method you selected from the order summary screen at checkout.
